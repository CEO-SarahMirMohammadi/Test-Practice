The general idea of Simple Auction is that everyone can send their bids during during a bidding period.
If the highest bid is raised, the previous higher bidder gets their Ether back.
After the end of the bidding period, the contract has to be called manually for the beneficiary to receivw their Ether. Contracts cannot activate themselves.
